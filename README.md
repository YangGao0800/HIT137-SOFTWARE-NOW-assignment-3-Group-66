# QUESTION 1

To run this application, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed and configured:

**Required Libraries:** Install the necessary Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

> pip install ultralytics opencv-python pillow tensorflow numpy

These libraries are used for image processing, model integration, and GUI development.  

1. **YOLOv8 Model:** The YOLOv8 model is used for object detection. The ultralytics library will automatically download the required model weights the first time the application is run.
2. **YResNet50:** The ResNet50 model is used for image classification. The tensorflow library will automatically download all the necessary packages to use pre-trained models like ResNet50 first time the application is run.
